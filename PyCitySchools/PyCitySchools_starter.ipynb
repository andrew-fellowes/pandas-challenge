    "* We analysed school data from the local government area to provide evidence to support future strategy and budget prioritisation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trends observed in this data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Across all curicula, we observed a negative correlation between both school funding and school size, and academic performance, such that the schools with higher average passes in maths, reading, and overall, tended to be smaller and to aportion a smaller budget per student.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This trend appeared to be associated with the smaller size of independant versus government schools. We saw that four of the bottom five performing schools on overall academic performance were government funded schools, whereas only two of the top five performing schools on overall academic performance were government funded. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data suggests that for optimal academic acheivement, limiting school size should feature in the strategic plans of our school boards.\n",
